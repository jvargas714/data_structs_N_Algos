______________________________________Key Concepts__________________________________________________
Worst case: 
	No matter what the algorithm will finish after X steps. Some advantages to using the worst case 
	scenario is obvious as the bound set will never be violated. 

Average Time Complexity:
	TBD 

expected time:
	Most commonly used metric, and it sits in between the other two. Avoids the problem with
	average time complexity by using the worst case input. Avoids worst case complexity by
	averaging over internal choices. In other words, it assumes typical behavior when we can
	actually be certain what typical means, and uses worst case behavior when we can't.

Best Time:
	TBD 

__________________________________Sorting Algorithms________________________________________________
	Note that the fastest sorting algorithm for arbitrary data takes O(n log n) time.

Merge Sort [ worst case: O(n log n) Average: O(n log n) ]
	- a recursive way to sort an array.
	- STEPS:
		1. first divide the array in half and recursively sort each half of the array.
		2. Then we combine the two halves into a sorted array.
	- relies on the fact that one can quickly combine two sorted arrays into a single sorted array. 
	- One can do so by keeping two pointers into the two sorted arrays. 
		* One repeatedly adds the smaller of the two numbers pointed to to the new array and 
			advances the pointer.

QuickSort [ worst case: O(n^2) expected time: 0(n log n) ]
	- sorting algorithm that takes O(n^2) time in the worst case and O(n log n) expected time
	- select an element at random to be the pivot. 
	- Divide the array into two groups
		1. group of elements greater than the pivot
		2. group of elements that are less than the pivot
		3. recursively sort elements before the pivot abd the portion after the pivot
	- typically very fast in practice, but worst case is still O(n^2)
	- make sure the mention that if you need to be guarenteed O(n log n) running time, mention
		another algo like mergesort 

_____________________________________Questions Mentioned____________________________________________
1. Reversing the words in a string
	 Write a function to reverse the order of words in a string in place. 

2. Coin Puzzle
	You have 8 coins which are all the same weight, except for one which is slightly heavier than 
	the others. You also have an old style balance, which allows you to weigh two piles of coins 
	to see which one is heavier. What is the fewest number of weighings that you can make which will
	tell you which coin is heavier?

3. Searching through an array
	Given a sorted array of integers, how can you find the location of a particular integer x?
	hint: use a binary search. Compare number with middle element at that point you will now which
		half the a value would be in. 

4. Preventing a deadlock ( in multi-threading )
	How can we ensure that a deadlock doesnt take place? 

5. What is polymorphism?

6. What is a virtual function? 

7.  A to I 
	Write a function to convert a string into an integer. (the function is called A to I because 
		we are converting an ASCII string into an integer.)

8. Nearest Neighbor
	Say you have an array containing information regarding n people. Each person is described using 
	a string (their name) and a number (their position along a number line). Each person has three 
	friends, which are the three ppl whos number is nearest their own. Describe an algo to id each 
	persons three friends. 

9. Cycle in a linked list Handout 2
	How can one determine whether a singly linked list has a cycle?

10. Data Structure for anagrams 
	Given an English word in the form of a string, how can you quickly find all valid anagrams for 
	that string ( all valid rearrangements of the letters that form valid english words)? Allowed to
	precompute whatever you want to and store whatever you optionally precompute on disk.

	Ans: 
		1. Pre-processing
			a. for each word in the dict we put the letters in alpha order ie hacking becomes 
				acghikn
			b. add the sorted letters as a key in the table and the original word as one of the 
				values in a list of values for that key. 
			c. for example the entry for opst would be the list [opts, post, stop, pots, tops, spot]
			d. basically its a hash table where each sorted letters map to a list so post and pots 
				would be opst which maps to the list containing all the words 

11. Factorial Zeros 
	Without using a calculator how many zeros at the end of 100! 
	Hint : remember that the number of zeros at the end of a number is equal to the number of times 
		10 (or 2*5) appears when you factor the number. Therefore we think about the prime 
		factorization of 100! and how many 2s and 5s there are. 
		
		1. number of many more 2s than 5s so we look at number of 5s 
		2. the number of 5s is also the number of 10s in the factorization 
		3. there is one 5 for every factor of 5 in or factorial multiplication 
		4. an extra 5 for 25 50 75 100 ie 5*5 5*5*2 5*5*3 5*5*2*2 --> * * * 
		5. from here just count the number of 5s 

12. Deck Shuffling 
	Given an array of distinct integers, give an algorithm to randomly reorder the integers so that 
	each possible reordering is equally likely. 

13. Path between nodes in a binary tree 
	Design an algorithm to find a path from one node in a binary tree to another

14. Compute 2^x 
	How quickly can you compute 2^x? 
	ANs: 1 << x // this is one left shifted by x 

15. Is power of 2
	How quickly can we determine whether a number is a power of 2?
