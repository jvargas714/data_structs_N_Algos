	Backtracking:  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backtracking-introduction/
		- Algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally
		- when a solution is found to not satisfy the constraints we ditch that solution (backtrack)
		- solved one piece at a time, removing solutions that do not satisfy the constraints of the problem at any time

		How to know when to use backtracking:
			- when searching for every possible combination in order to solve an optimization problem
			- when solving a constraint satisfaction problem (CSPs)
				* CSPs are mathematical questions defined as a set of objects whose state must satisfy a number of
					constraints or limitations. 
				* examples: 
					1. Sudoku solving algorithm 
					2. Eight queen puzzle 
					3. Crosswords
					4. Futoshiki
			- well defined constraints
